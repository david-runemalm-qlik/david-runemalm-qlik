ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

Iâ€™m a curious developer who enjoys exploring new concepts, ideas, and technologies. Iâ€™m especially passionate about Python, .NET, and the fascinating world of AI â€” always looking for ways to experiment, learn, and build better solutions.

Whether itâ€™s diving into a new framework, prototyping an AI-driven feature, or refining existing code, I love uncovering how things work (and how they can work better). Iâ€™m excited to collaborate, share, and learn together â€” so feel free to reach out, open a discussion, or ping me on a PR!

Letâ€™s build cool things ðŸš€
